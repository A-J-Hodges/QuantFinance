    "### 2.1.1 Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a formal method of testing your assumptions with data and statistics. With hypothesis testing, we create two (or more) competing hypothesis and decide which is more likely. In a variety of circumstances, we consider something \"unlikely\" if it has less than 5% chance of happening, but note this would mean that this happens in 1 in 20 experiments *anyway, just due to chance*."

    "A common hypothesis pair is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_0$, the Null hypothesis, is that any difference between the data in our sample, and the general population, is caused strictly by chance.\n",
    "* $H_A$, the Alternative hypothesis, is that there is a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses must be mutually exclusive, as in it cannot be that both are true. They do not have to be exhaustive, i.e. account for all possible scenarios, but it is often the case. It is usually easier to compute the probability for $H_0$, i.e. $P(H_0)$ and then just compute $P(H_A) = 1 - P(H_0)$. This only applies if the pair is exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a sample, say trading firms using statistical analysis for decision making. Our Null hypothesis is that these firms are no different to the *population*, which may be either \"all trading firms\" or \"random people picking stocks\". We set up an experiment (more below) and find that we have a 4% chance that our Null hypothesis would generate results this extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might then say that, because the chance is so low, we reject the Null hypothesis that any different is strictly by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this example, there is still a one in 25 chance of obtaining the result purely through \"luck\"."

    "Importantly, this does *not* mean that we accept that using statistical analysis causing trading firms to profit more than normal. There may be some other factors involved that are causing the difference. While this might sound like [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word), this type of inference happens all the time. For instance, firms using statistical analysis might get their advantage from simply a more careful and thorough analysis, rather than the specific statistical analysis they apply. They might be run by larger firms (who can afford the extra staff to do the statistical analysis and have access to more data), or many other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could also be simply by chance, as the above comic demonstrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common logical fallacy called *Denying the antecedent*:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If P, then Q.\n",
    "    Therefore, if not P, then not Q.\n",
    "\n",

    "Be wary of this fallacy. Statistics is often pessimistic in this regard - it rarely tells you that you are correct, it generally just tells you if there is a strong chance you are wrong.\n",

    "### Common problems and issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large P values\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not get a lower p-value, you do not have a strong result. We cannot accept the null hypothesis, we just \"fail to reject\" it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to run our above statistic and get a p value of 0.2 (assuming a threshold of significance of 0.05), we do not \"accept the null hypothesis\", we simply fail to reject it at our significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important also to ensure the p value threshold is set *before* the experiment, and not after you get your results. If you do not, it is tempting to just \"change\" the threshold after you get your results. This removes any independence you had in your result, and the experimenter is effectively arbitrarily changing the result - why bother doing the test in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common value for the threshold is 0.05. There is no basis in this value, it is just \"what is generally used\". If your hypothesis is a matter of life or death, this value is probably too high. If it is of no great consequence, it might be too low. Reason about the value before blindly accepting on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that people are generally terrible dealing with low probabilities. The difference between a false positive of 0.02 and one of 0.01 is \"one in fifty\" compared to \"one in one hundred\". That's twice as likely for the first. Typically, it can be better to estimate with an intuitive \"one in ...\" amount, then convert that to a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Simultaneous experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "With modern computers able to run simulations continuously, and at scale, a common issue arising is that the p-value thresholds most commonly used (i.e. 0.05) are only valid for individual tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we had the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: Stock price changes are random for IBM on Mondays\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_A$: Stock prices are more likely to drop on Mondays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We might test this hypothesis and get a p value of 0.2, indicating there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore do not automatically buy on Tuesdays after the drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might then consider \"does this pattern hold on any other day?\". So we consider the same hypothesis, but for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. We find the following significance levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monday: 0.2\n",
    "* Tuesday: 0.1\n",
    "* Wednesday: 0.8\n",
    "* Thursday: 0.04\n",
    "* Friday: 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Aha! Thursdays have a *highly significant* effect. We fail to reject all other null hypothesis, accept the Thursday one, and start trading. \n",
    "\n",
    "What went wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research the \"Multiple comparisons problem\" and identify a way to fix our hypothesis. We still want to check if any day has a significant value for our hypothesis, but we want to do it in a rigorous way.\n",
    "2. Does our finding hold after adjusting? The solution uses one specific method of fixing the thresholds - if you choose another, then you may get another answer."

    "1. The more tests we do, the more likely we'll reject a hypothesis by chance. Hence, adjust the P-value for increased number of tests, for example the Bonferroni adjustment.\n",

    "### Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic we will get into in more detail later, but a useful one to touch on here, is the use of simulations for computing p values. When testing a hypothesis, you can use a simulation of your null hypothesis, and then with that simulation, estimate the likelihood of findings like your sample. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: The AUD/USD change is a random walk (that is, there is no pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_A$: The AUD/USD change tends to follow the previous change with lag 1 (that is, if the previous change was up, it is more likely this change will be up too)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A little more formally, if we ignore \"no change\", we might say that $p$, the proportion of changes that are consistent with the previous change, is 50%, when we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0: p = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_A: p > 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we might analyse some data and find that we get a proportion with a value of 0.6, that is, the proportion of times that a change follows the previous change is 0.6 (60%). Is this \"significant\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">That value above is artificial - we compute the real data in the exercise later</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this, we can create a simulation. In this simulation, we are focused on our null hypothesis - that there is no relationship between a change and the previous one. We might run our experiment for one year's worth of data (i.e. 365 changes), with each change randomly and uniformly chosen from \"up\" or \"down\". We then measure the proportion values to get our result from the simulation. Repeat many times, and you can then use this to estimate the p-value, or the probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the USD/AUD prices from Quandl\n",
    "2. Identify whether each change is \"up\" or \"down\" and compute the sample proportion value (it was 0.6 in the artificial data above)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extended Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and run the simulation mentioned above, where we simulate a random walk scenario and compute the proportion of times a change corresponds with the previous change.\n",
    "2. Run the simulation many times\n",
    "3. Compute the p value and determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis."
